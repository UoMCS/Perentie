			<p>Perentie is a simple, graphical CPU monitor and debugger supporting a
			range of architectures. It is designed by the <a
			href="http://cs.man.ac.uk/">University of Manchester School of Computer
			Science</a> for educational use by students learning about CPU
			architecture and CPU design.</p>
			
			<p>After becoming frustrated with the task of extending <a
			href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/">Komodo</a>
			to cope with the 16-bit <a
			href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2011/COMP22111/">STUMP</a> and <a
			href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2011/COMP12111/">MU0</a>
			processors, Perentie was designed as a more flexible debug monitor tool.
			Perentie hopes maintain compatibility with Komodo and, one day, to
			overtake Komodo.</p>
			
			<p><a href="backends.htm">Various targets are supported</a> including
			emulators and the <a
			href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/ARM_board_2/">
			Manchester Lab Board</a>. Currently the STUMP and MU0 architectures are
			well supported as well as partial support for ARM. Completely new
			architectures can be added with a modest amount of work.</p>
